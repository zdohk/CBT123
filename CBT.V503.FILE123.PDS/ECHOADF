ECHOADF CSECT                                                            000000
*------------------------------------------------------------------*
*  THIS PROGRAM IS ALMOST AS SIMPLE AS IEFBR14.
*
*  THIS SYSTEM WAS INVENTED IN 1986 BY JEFFREY R. BROIDO.
*
*  ALL THIS PROGRAM DOES, IS TO SET RC=12 INTO REGISTER 15, AND
*  RETURN TO THE CALLER, WHICH SEEMS USELESS, BUT IT ISN'T.
*
*  IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT IF A TSO COMMAND DOES THIS, THE TSO
*  TERMINAL MONITOR PROGRAM REFLECTS THE CONTENTS OF THE COMMAND
*  BUFFER TO THE TERMINAL.  SO IF YOU EXECUTE THIS PROGRAM AS A
*  TSO COMMAND, YOU GET ITS NAME AND ITS PARAMETERS REFLECTED
*  BACK TO THE TERMINAL.  THIS EFFECT ONLY HAPPENS IF YOU ARE IN
*  TSO SESSION MANAGER MODE (EXEC PGM=ADFMDF03 INSTEAD OF IKJEFT01).
*
*  IF YOU ARE NOT IN SESSION MANAGER, USE MY OTHER PROGRAMS,
*  ECHOTPUT (USES TPUT TO REFLECT THE COMMAND TO THE TERMINAL), OR
*  ECHOPGM  (USES PUTLINE TO REFLECT THE CONTENTS OF THE COMMAND
*            BUFFER)
*
*  THEREFORE, IF YOU WANT TO NULLIFY A TSO COMMAND, JUST ALIAS ITS
*  NAME TO THIS PROGRAM, AND PUT BOTH NAMES IN A LOAD LIBRARY THAT
*  IS CONCATENATED AHEAD OF SYS1.CMDLIB , FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN PUT
*  THIS PROGRAM INTO A STEPLIB IN THE LOGON PROC, WITH ALL ITS
*  ALIASES.  THEREFORE, IF YOU EXECUTE THE NAME OF THE ALIAS, YOU
*  GET ITS NAME REFLECTED BACK TO THE TSO TERMINAL, AND NO OTHER
*  ACTION OCCURS.
*
*  YOU CAN CREATE A FEW, OR VERY MANY ALIASES TO THIS PROGRAM.
*  JUST USE THE PDS COMMAND PROCESSOR (FROM CBT TAPE FILE 182)
*  MANY TIMES (IN A BATCH PROGRAM IF YOU'D LIKE).  THE COMMANDS ARE:
*
*      PDS 'YOUR.LOAD.LIBRARY'
*      ALIAS ECHOADF NAME1
*      ALIAS ECHOADF NAME2
*      ALIAS ECHOADF NAME3
*      ALIAS ECHOADF NAME4
*      ALIAS ECHOADF NAME5
*      END
*
*  WITH THE PDS COMMAND PROCESSOR, YOU CAN CREATE HUNDREDS OR
*  THOUSANDS OF ALIASES TO THIS PROGRAM.  YOU ARE NOT LIMITED BY
*  LINKAGE EDITOR RESTRICTIONS.  YOU CAN EVEN ALIAS THIS PROGRAM
*  TO EVERY NAME IN SYS1.CMDLIB AND IN OTHER LIBRARIES, EXCEPT FOR
*  THOSE NAMES THAT THE (LIMITED) TSO SESSION NEEDS.  TO ALLOW THE
*  USE OF A PROGRAM BY THE TSO SESSION, JUST DELETE THE ALIAS.
*  TO FORBID A COMMAND, JUST MAKE AN ALIAS WITH THE PDS COMMAND
*  AS ABOVE, TO THAT NAME.  CHEAP TSO COMMAND SECURITY.
*
*  I'D BET YOU'D NEVER REALIZED THAT TSO COMMAND SECURITY COULD
*  BE SO SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT.  SINCE THE COMMANDS ENTERED REFLECT
*  BACK TO THE TERMINAL, YOU CAN EVEN LOG THE RESPONSES, USING
*  THE TSO SESSION MANAGER, AND THE SMCOPY COMMAND.
